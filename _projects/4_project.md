Stars form in multiple system. This multiplicity arises from the fragmentation of large
filaments, dense cores, and/or massive accretion disk in the interstellar medium. Tha fact
that we observe stars isolated stars like our sun could be a result of subsequent
interactions in evolved phases of the stellar life. Likewise, planets and disks have been
observed obiting around binary stars, either in circmstellar configuration (when the
  binary star acts as an external perturber) and in circumbinary configuration. Particularly,
  Keppler and Tess missions have dicovered around a dozen of circumbinary planets while
  the correspondendt circumbinary disks are rearer. For the circumstellar case, more
  additional trends have been observed. For example, it is an observational result that
  ocurrence rate of circumstellar planets increases in function of the binary separation
  matching the value derived for individual stars for separations beyond 200 au. Either in
  circumstellar or in binary configuration, the dynamics of planets is expected
  to be richer than in the individual star case where the typical timescales for evolution
  scaling as the distances among the bodies.   

The goal of my masters reseach project was to study the secular evolution of hierarchical three body systems
with an special focus on circumstellar planets in binary stellar systems. I explored the
question of to what extent, the variability in stellar bulk properties during the pre-main
sequence phase can alter the dynamical evolution of the planet. To adreess this question,
I derived explicit formulaes for the equations of motion up to octupolar order and implemented a C-based code
to integrate the equations of motion including the conservative
motion to the gravitational interaction among the objects, the non-conservative
motion due to the lack of sphericity both in the star and the planet and also
due to the bodily tides exerceted mainly on the planet, and a general relativity
correction for the time evolution of the argumenter of the pericenter which might
be relevant in the case of a planet on a highly eccentric orbit.

To benchmark the code, we revisited the secular evolution of the highly eccentric planet
HD 80606b and found that the timescale of evolution differs greatly when one includes
octupolar terms in the Hamiltoninan. The extra terms induce an additional modulation on
the evolution of the eccentricity and semimajor axis which delays the system reaching
a steady state. Coupling the code with a classical stellar evolution track, we simulated
the secular evolution of a hypothetical circumstellar planet during the pre-main sequence
phase of a 0.6 solar mass star and found that a contracting star speeds up the
secular evolution of the system decreasing by a factor of two the time it takes
the orbit of the planet to shrink to a half of its initial value.

We conclude that a the octupolar contribution to the secularised Hamiltonionan is
important for assessing the correct timescales of evolution of circumstellar planets.
We also conclude that the effect of stellar evolution during the pre-main sequence
phase should be taken into account to describe the architecture of extrasolar systems.
