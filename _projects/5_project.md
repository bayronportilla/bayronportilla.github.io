Detailed modelling of the dynamics of planets around low mass stars requires to include tidal
and permanent deformation effects. Several exoplanets recently discovered
are expected to be trapped in low order spin-orbit
resonances due to the interaction with the host star. Different attempts
to describe the spin-orbit coupling have been built on the seminal work by
Kaula (1964) who was the first to connect the tidal lagging of a solid body with
the energy dissipation in the mantle. This opened the door
for the inclusion of novel rheological models aimed to couple the
spin-orbit state of an exoplanet with the mechanisms of internal energy dissipation.

In my bachelor project I worked out the problem of estimating the spin-orbit state
when tidal and permanent deformation torques act on planet-star systems. I was particularly interested
in the tidal framework presented in Efroimsky (2012) (one of the many branches derived from
Kaula's work) which capitalizes on Andrade's rheological model.

I co-authored a publication that revisited the case of the GJ 667C multiplanetary system
The science question of this work is: does the
probability for planets b and c of reaching a low order spin-orbit resonance varies significantly
due to the orbital perturbation
by other planets? Numerical simulations for the rotational evolution coupled with
the output of an N-body orbital integration found that the final rotational state is
not significantly affected by the presence of the remaining planets.
