Modelling the dynamics of planets around low mass star requires to include tidal
and permanent deformation effects of the bodies involved in the system. Several of
the recently discovered exoplanets are expected to be parked in a low spin-orbit
resonance due to the interaction with the host star and several modern attempts
to describe the spin-orbit coupling have been built upon the seminal work by
Kaula 1964 who was the first in connecting the lag in the response of a rocky body
to the tidal force with the energy dissipation in the mantle. This opens the door
to the inclusion of novel rheological models that couple the
spin-orbit state of an exoplanet and the internal energy dissipation mechanisms.

In my bachelor project I worked out the problem of spin-orbit state due to tidal
and permanent deformation of the planet-star system. I was particularly interested
in the tidal framework presented in Efroimsky (one of the many branches derived from
Kaula's work) which is based upon Andrade's rheological model.

I co-authored a publication that revisited the case of the GJ667 exoplanetary system.
The main goal of this work led by my bachelors advisor was to assess how does the
probability for reaching a low order spin-orbit resonance depend on the orbital perturbation
by the other planets in the system? Using a numerical integration of the equation
of motions for the rotational state informed by the output of an N-body integration
of the system including six planets, we found that the final rotational state of the
planet GJ 667C is not affected by the presence of the remaining planets.

Take a look to the publication if intereseted in learning more.
