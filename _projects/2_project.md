ALMA revealed several features in the sub-mm spectrum towards PDS 70 that are associated
with molecules in the coldest
regions of the disk. Since the gas component dominates the disk's mass,
inferring its distribution across
the disk is important to understand some of the most prominent features such as
the planets in the cavity. Accordingly, the gas column density is a key parameter on which
several predictions are built upon. A physically
motivated model for the gas phase is needed to understand the observations and to test
theoretical predictions. Our goal is to develop a thermochemical model to explain the
line emission observed from PDS 70 and use it to estimate the mass of the
gap carving planets.

Using ALMA data for three CO isotopologues (CO J=2-1, 13CO J=2-1,
  and C18O J=2-1), we construct a thermochemical model using the
Protoplanetary Disk Model Code [ProDiMo](https://prodimo.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/team).
The first part of the modelling consisted in
a parametric exploration to explain the signal from the spatially unresolved inner disk.
Then, we used an iterative
procedure to fit the signal
from the spatially resolved outer disk. The models were post-proceded with CASA and with the GoFish and ProDiMopy packages in order to
obtain the radial brightness distribution that was directly
compared to the observed profiles.

We found a peak value for the gas column density
of ~0.13 g/cm2 at ~75 au. The minimum value for the gas column density is ~0.003 g/cm2
and correlates with the location of the planet PDS 70 b. Coupling the level of gas depletion in
the cavity informed by our model with the theoretical work by Duffel and Dong 2015, we estimate the
value of the mass of each planet in ~2 Mjup which is consistent with the work by Wang et al 2021
using infrared spectroscopy.     

This project is in the final correction phase and I expect to submit the paper by the end of 2022.
Stay tuned for the manuscript!
