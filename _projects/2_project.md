ALMA revealed several features in the submillimeter spectrum towards PDS 70 which are associated
with molecules in the coldest
regions of the disk. Since the gas component dominates the disk's mass,
inferring its distribution across
the disk is important to understand some of the most prominent features such as
the planets in the cavity. Accordingly, the gas column density is a key parameter on which
several predictions are built upon. A physically
motivated model for the gas phase is needed to understand the observations and to test
theoretical predictions. Our goal is to develop a thermochemical model to explain the
submillimeter molecular emission observed from PDS 70 and use it to estimate the mass of the
gap-carving planets.

Using ALMA data of three CO isotopologues (CO J=2-1, 13CO J=2-1,
  and C18O J=2-1), I constructed a thermochemical model using the
Protoplanetary Disk Model code [ProDiMo](https://prodimo.iwf.oeaw.ac.at/team).
The first part of the modelling was
a parametric exploration to fit the signal from the spatially unresolved inner disk.
Then, I used an iterative
procedure to reproduce the signal
from the spatially resolved outer disk. The models were post-proceded with CASA and with the GoFish and ProDiMopy packages in order to
obtain the radial brightness distribution that was directly
compared to the observed profiles.

We found a peak value for the gas column density
of $$\sim 0.13 \ \mathrm{g}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$ at ~75 au and a minimum value of
$$\sim 0.003 \ \mathrm{g}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$$
at a semi-major axis equal to the orbital separation of the planet PDS 70 b, ~20 au.
I use the level of gas depletion in
the cavity that is directly inferred from our model as an input to the scaling relation
presented in Duffel & Dong 2015 and estimated the
mass of each planet to be equal to $$\sim 4 M_\mathrm{jup}$$. This is consistent within the uncertainties
of the value reported by Wang et al. 2021 that was obtained using infrared spectroscopy.     

Stay tuned for the manuscript!
