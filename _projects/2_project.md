title: A thermochemical model for PDS 70

ALMA observations revealed several spectral features in the sub-mm spectrum towards
PDS 70. Those features are associated to rotational transitions from several
molecular species present in the disk. Modelling of the gas phase in the disk can
help to understand those observations.

In this project I developed a thermochemical model based on the model for the
continuum presented in [project 1](/projects/1_project/). We use propietary ALMA
data of the CO and its isotopologues to construct a thermochemical model based on
the model for the continuum presented in [project 1](/projects/1_project/). Given
the angular resolution and sensitivity of the data set, we can spatially resolve
faint emission from optically thick and thin isotopologues that allow us to
estimate the gas distribution and the temperature structure of the gas.

Once the model has been found, we aim to connect the different physical parameters
to well-established theories of planet formation and predict the masses of the
gap-carving panets observed in the infrared. This offers a unique opportunity to
brdige the gap between observations and models and offers a direct way to test the
predictions of planet formation theories since we there are two planets resinding
in the cavity.

This project is work in progress and I expect to submit the paper by the end of the
calendar year.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
