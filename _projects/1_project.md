PDS 70 is as T-Tauri star with a protoplanetary disk first discovered via infrared
excess analysis. The high resolution and sensitivity of ALMA allowed to spatially
resolve the disk in the sub-mm continuum revealing the presence of inner and outer disk, and a central
cavity ~20 au wide.

Additionally, observations with the SPHERE instrument at VLT demonstrated the presence
an embedded planet (PDS 70 b) in the cavity that was confirmed later on by H-alpha observations.
The later observation also detected a second source of accretion close to the outer
dust ring that was later confirmed to have planetary nature (PDS 70 c). A subsequent ALMA
campaign confirmed that the c planet is surrounded by a circumplanetary disk (CPD).

Therefore, PDS 70 is the first bona-fide observatinal confirmation for the long-standing
theory that planets form embedded in disks of gas and dust.

In my first PhD project, I developed a 2D continuum radiative transfer model for
the PDS 70 disk. I analysed ALMA and VLT/SPHERE archival data of the spatially resolved protoplanetary disks to find
a set of parameters able to explain those observations. Our model suggest an optically thin inner disk, a dust
depleted cavity with a maximum dust column density of 1e-5 g/cm2. Dust filtration at the outer edge of
the cavity is able to explain the measurement set. However, due to the several degeneracies
among the parameters, an homogeneous size distribution across the disk can also
explain the observations, as we demonstrated in the second project.  

The model is then extended to three dimensions to include a second
source of photons to simulate the planet PDS 70 c and its circumplanetary disk. The model suggests the CPD is an optically thick structure
and constrained the amount of dust to be in the range 0.07-0.7 Earth masses.
