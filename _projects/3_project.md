In this project, I study the theoretical aspects that set the equilibrium temperature
of dust grains in circumplanetary disks. This objects present several challengues
to numerical integrators. For example, due to their compactness, they represent
regions of very high optical depth where estimates of the energy based on the
radom walk of photon packages become inneficient. To circumbent this problem, either
long integration times or diffusive techniques are required. The first one has a
computatinal limitation and the second one is challenging when the system under
modelling is not axially symmetric.

Therefore, semianalytical model become handy. I this project, I am extending the
current models for equilibrium temperature of CPD's to consider a more realistic
scenario for CPD's embedded in cavities in protoplanetary disk where the stellar
photons are another source of heating in addition to the central planet. I study
the implication of the stellar light attenuation inside the CPD to the potential
synthesis of exomoons in those systems.

This project is under development and will be the one of the chapters in my PhD
thesis.  

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
