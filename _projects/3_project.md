The formation of regular moons in the Solar System likely happened in
circumplanetary disks (CPDs) around the young Jupiter and Saturn. To date, only two
CPD candidates have been detected: one in the PDS 70 disk and another
one in the AS 209 system.
If exomoons form in CPDs, their
composition will be regulated by the properties of the disk at the formation place. Particularly,
the location with respect to the CO snowline
is important because of its large molecular abundance.

The CO snowline happens where the dust equilibrium temperature in the midplane matches the CO desoprtion
temperature. The major dust heating processes arise from planetary and stellar irradiation and
commonly, the strength of the stellar radiation field is assumed to be constant throughout the CPD.
In this work, I relaxed this assumption allowing dust attenuation to act.
I hypothesize that a natural consequence of this relaxation is the existence of a second CO snowline at larger
planetocentric distances.

To test this hypothesis, I developed a semi-analytical model including an attenuated stellar radiation field.
The resulting temperature profile shows an reversal
point at intermediate planetocentric distances, which was verified
using a full set of three-dimensional radiative transfer simulations.
I then used the final temperarture profile to solve for the distance at which the temperature
equals the CO desportion and found two roots mathematically valid.
Physically, these two values corresponds to two different snowlines in the CPD.    

What are the implications of this for the formation of exomoons? What is the role of
the second snowline for the radial drift of solids form the outer CPD?  Can we test
this prediction observationally? This project is under development and will be the one
of the chapters in my PhD thesis.
