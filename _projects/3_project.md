The formation of regular moons in the Solar System is thought to had happened in
disks of gas and dust surrounding the young Jupiter and Saturn in a process similar
to that in the protosolar nebula which originated the solar system. Oustide the
Solar System, two CPD candidates have been detected: one in the PDS 70 and another
one in the AS 209 system. In the former case, the CPD is embedded in a dust depleted
cavity where the stellar radiation is free to penetreate. Although there
are no exomoon detected to date, this is likely an observational bias and their
detection is an active area of research. If exomoons indeed form within CPDs, their
composition will be related to the location of their formation in the CPD's midplane. In particular,
the location of the formation with respect to the CO iceline that probes the outermost regions of a CPD
is particularly important because of the elemental abundance of each atom.

The location of the CO snowline in CPDs obey is given by the distance
from the planet where the dust temperature in the midplane matches the CO desoprtion
temperature. Classically, the equilibrium temperature is computed solving the
heating-cooling balance for the dust distribution; where the dominant heating
terms come from the the planetary and stellar irradiation, and from the accretion
luminosity. In particular the stellar radiation field is assumed to be constant throughout the CPD
which implies a constant contribution to the dust equilibrium temperature in
the midplane. Therefore, the radial dust temperature in the CPD
shifts up and down by a constant factor depending on the stellar luminosity and the
planet-star distance. In this work, I relax the condition of a constant stellar
radiation field and allow it to attenuate due to the interaction with the disk's
dust. A natural consequence of this is existence of a second CO iceline at larger
planetocentric distances.

To test my hypothesis, I derived from the first principles an expression for the
stellar radiation field as a function of the planetocentric distance. Then, I solved
the heating-cooling balance. The so derived profile shows a reversal
in the temperature which, depending on the initial conditions, can lead to temperature
values at the CPD's outer edge to be different by a factor of two. To verify this
finding, I ran a full numerical three-dimensional radiative transfer simulation
finding that my semi-analytical model is in good agreement with the numerical solution.
When the final temperarture profile is used to solve for the desorption temperature of
CO, two mathematically allowed solutions are found, which physically corresponds to
two differnt icelines in the CPD midplane.    

What are the implications of this for the formation of exomoons? What is the role of
the second iceline in the context of radial drift of solids form the outer CPD?  How can we test
this prediction observationally? This project is under development and will be the one
of the chapters in my PhD thesis.
