I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at The Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on characterising the physical
structure of protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks. I develop radiative
transfer models to interpret ground- and space-based observations of disks across
a broad range of wavelengths. I use those models to address some of the open 
questions in the quest to connect the observed properties of exoplanets to their natal disks.

I have also worked on the evolved phases of planetary systems. In my master's degree,
I studied the secular evolution of hierarchical three body systems. In my bachelor's
thesis, I worked on the tidal evolution of tightly packed exoplanets subjected to N-body
perturbations.
