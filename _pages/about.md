I am a PhD candidate working with Professor Inga Kamp at the Kapteyn Astronomical
Institute. My research focuses on characterising the physical
structure of protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks. I develop radiative
transfer models to interpret ground- and space-based observations across
a broad range of wavelengths and use them to test different aspects of
planet formation processes. My work aims at bridging the gap between theory and
observations of planet and moon forming regions.

I have also worked on the evolved phases of planetary systems. During my master
I studied the secular evolution of hierarchical three body systems and in my bachelors
I studied the tidal evolution of tightly packed exoplanets subjected to N-body
perturbations.
