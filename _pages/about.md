I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Eberly College of Science, within the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, at the Pennsylvania State University. My research focuses on characterising the physical
structure of protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks. I develop radiative
transfer models to interpret ground- and space-based observations across
a broad range of wavelengths and use them to test different aspects of
planet formation processes.

I have also worked on the evolved phases of planetary systems. In my master's degree,
I studied the secular evolution of hierarchical three body systems. In my bachelor's
thesis, I worked on the tidal evolution of tightly packed exoplanets subjected to N-body
perturbations.
