I am a PhD candidate working under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Inga Kamp at the
Kapteyn Astronomical Institute in The Netherlands. My research focuses on the
physical characterisation of protoplanetary and circumplanetary disks using
radiative transfer models of their continuum and line emission.My goal is to test
different aspects of the theoretical models of planet formation bridging the gap
between theory and observations using static (time-independent) models of radiation
transfer.

In the theoretical side, I am particularly interested in expanding our understanding
of the thermal environment of circumplanetary disk where they are embedded in the natal
protoplanetary disk. I study the implications of external source of heating, the
implications for the formation of exomoons, and for the CPD detectability.

I am also interested in the evolved phases of planetary systems, particularly in
the dynamical interactions among planets and stars. During my master I studied the
secular evolution of hierarchical three body systems and during my bachelors
I studied the tidal evolution of thightly packed exoplanets subject to N-body
perturbations.
